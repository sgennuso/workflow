# Workflow

## For a developer creating a new template
- Admin creates a fork of [template-starter](https://github.com/ubiweb-media/template-starter) with the name: `template-{name}`
- Provide the new repo to a dev and have them follow the template usage instructions
- Repo can be read only. Have the dev fork it and they can create a pull request for the admin to accept. This is best used for devs that are not part of the organization so you don't need to grant Github account access. Otherwise, if for example you're working with an internal dev, simply give write access to this repo and they can push their commits directly.

## For a developer creating a new ubiweb domain.
